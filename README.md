# AubRUG March Presentation

Today we'll make the first steps to deploying a Rails application.
We'll use the excellent [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/)
by Michael Hartl as our basis, including using the
[Cloud9](https://c9.io/) development environment.


## Set up GitHub, Cloud9, and Heroku Accounts

To jump-start your foray into the Ruby language and the Ruby on Rails
web framework, I suggest setting up accounts on GitHub, Cloud9,
and Heroku. They're all free, so no worries. (Skip these if you already
have accounts.)

### GitHub

Many Rubyists use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to maintain their
projects. GitHub offers hosting for unlimited open-source projects, so you'll
often find yourself using Ruby libraries which are maintained on GitHub,
not to mention storing your own projects online as well. Do the following
to register:

* Visit <http://github.com>
* Enter a username, email, and password, and "Sign Up".
* Choose the Free plan, then "Finish sign up".
* Optional for EDU users: request a discount/free upgrade by visiting
  <https://education.github.com/>

### Cloud9

Setting up Ruby and Ruby on Rails to work on your personal computer
is a pain compared to actually writing Ruby and Ruby on Rails code.
(Particularly if you're a Windows user.) So to get started, we'll
recommend using a cloud development environment: all you need to write
and deploy a Rails application is a modern browser.

* Visit <https://c9.io/> and click "Sign Up"
* Click the GitHub logo to sign up with your GitHub account, and click
  "Authorize Application".

### Heroku

To relieve the pain point of getting a web app which works in your
Cloud9 account (or your local development environment)
to also work on the internet, we'll use Heroku for deployment. By just
`git push`ing your code, it will automatically be provisioned and
hosted at `https://app-name.herokuapp.com`.

* Visit <http://heroku.com/> and click "Sign up for free"
* Enter a first name, last name, and email, and "Create Free Account"
* Confirm your account by clicking the link sent to your email.
* Create a password. Your username is your email address.
